This project is my implementation of a Tarot Reading Simulation.
The goal of this is to make a program that can be used to faciliate tarot readings,
including shuffling a deck of tarot cards, laying them out in a pattern, and providing information
about each card and the relationship between them.

Currently in very early stages.
